# Overview
The IVI-NSCLC model simulates disease progression for different sequential treatment strategies using a continuous time state transition model (CTSTM). Treatment sequences that can be modeled are shown in the figure below. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can be used at first line. Possible second line treatments (2L) and treatments beyond second line (2L+) depend on whether a patient acquired a T790M mutation.

<br>
<br>
```{r, out.width = "800px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("treatment-strategies.png")
``` 
<br>
<br>

The model structure depends on whether the model starts at 1L or 2L treatment. If the model begins at 1L, then either a four-state CTSTM or a three-state CTSTM can be used. We prefer the four-state CTSTM because it explicitly models 2L treatments; however, there is no 2L evidence following some 1L treatments (i.e., osimertinib), so a three-state model must be used in these cases. 

In the four-state model, patients begin 1L treatment in stable disease (S1) and can either transition to the progression state (P1) or death (D). At progression, move to the progression-free (stable) state (S2) with 2L treatment and can again either have their disease progress (P3) or die. At P3, patients begin 2L+ treatment and remain in the progressed state until death. Time-varying hazard rates for transitions between states $r$ and $s$ and are denoted by $h^{rs}(u)$. 

<br>
```{r, out.width = "800px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("modstruct4_1L.png")
```
<br>
<br>

In the three-state model, all hazard rates are based on 1L clinical trial evidence. Patients begin in stable disease (S1) and they can transition to the progression state (P1) or death (D).

<br>
```{r, out.width = "800px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("modstruct3_1L.png")
```
<br>
<br>

If the model begins at second line, then a three-state model nearly identical to the figure above must be used. In the 2L case, patients begin in stable disease (S2) and transition to progression (P2) or death (D).

The three and four-state model structures are used to construct an economic model that consists of three primary submodels: (i) a disease progression model (i.e., transition model) that determines transitions between health states, (ii) a utility model that simulates the health-state utility of each health state, and (iii) a set of cost models that simulates the costs associated with multiple cost categories (i.e., drug acquisition and administration costs, inpatient medical costs, outpatient medical costs, adverse event costs, and productivity losses). The economic model simulates relevant outcomes of interest including the probabilities of being in each of the health states over time, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs by category. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) is used to propagate uncertainty in the model input parameters throughout the model.

Two R packages are needed to simulate the model: the `iviNSCLC` and [hesim](https://innovationvalueinitiative.github.io/hesim/) packages. We will also use [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and [scales](https://scales.r-lib.org/) for plotting, [knitr](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-7.html) to create tables, and the [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki) package to manipulate data and simulation output.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("iviNSCLC")
library("hesim")
library("data.table")
library("ggplot2")
library("scales")
library("knitr")
ggplot2::theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

# Parameter estimates
A number of different statistical models are used to parameterize the economic model. First, Bayesian network meta-analyses (NMAs) were conducted to parameterize multi-state statistical models for the health-state transitions and the probability of grade 3/4 adverse events. Second, estimates from the literature were used to characterize probability distributions of utility and each cost category. The parameter estimates, which load with the `iviNSCLC` package, are as follows:

* `params_mstate_nma`: The posterior distribution for the parameters of the Bayesian multi-state NMA.
* `params_ae_nma`: The posterior distribution for the parameters of the Bayesian NMA of adverse events (coming soon).
* `params_utility`: The probability distribution of the health state utility associated with each health state (S1, P1, and P2).
* `params_costs_tx`: The drug acquisition and administration costs for each treatment. 
* `params_costs_inpt`: Inpatient medical costs by health state (S1, P1, and P2).
* `params_costs_op`: Outpatient medical costs by health state (S1, P1, and P2).
* `params_costs_ae`: The costs associated with each of the adverse events from the NMA. 
* `params_prod`: Productivity losses by health state (S1, P1, and P2).

Samples from the joint probability distribution of all parameters for the PSA can be drawn using the `sample_params()` function. When draws from the posterior distribution are already provided (e.g., `params_mstate_nma`, `params_ae_nma`), this function samples from the already existing posterior distribution. When a posterior distribution does not exist (e.g., `params_utility`), draws are taken from a probability distribution that approximates a relevant Bayesian posterior distribution. [TABLE TO BE ADDED SHOWING THE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS FOR EACH SET OF PARAMETERS].

```{r}
params <- sample_params(n = 100)
```

# Economic model
We provide two example analyses: a four-state model for 1L treatment and a three-state model for 2L treatment. Importantly, different modeling approaches should be used for each scenario. Since a "clock-forward" multi-state NMA was conducted separately by line of treatment, the four-state model is a mixture of clock-forward and "clock-reset" models. In the clock-reset approach, time $u$ in $h^{rs}(u)$ resets after each transition whereas in the clock-forward approach time $u$ refers to time since the start of the model (see the tutorial [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.2712) for a more detailed discussion). In the four-state model, the clock resets when entering state S1. Conversely, in the three-state model (either starting at 1L or 2L), the transition rates are always estimated using a NMA of treatments within a single line, so a clock-forward multi-state model must be used. 

An individual-level simulation is required to simulate the mixture of clock-forward and clock-reset models, but a cohort model can be used (and is computationally faster) to simulate a clock-forward model. The individual and cohort-level models are simulated in R using the `IndivCtstm` and `CohortCtstm` [`CohortCtstm` IS NOT YET AVAILABLE] classes from the [hesim](https://innovationvalueinitiative.github.io/hesim/) package, respectively.

## A four-state model for first line treatment
### Patient population
The first step in the analysis is to define the target population. In the individual-level model, a sufficient number of patients must be simulated so that expected (i.e., mean) outcomes are stable across simulations. In this example, we simulate 1,000 patients.

```{r}
pats <- create_patients(n = 1000)
```

### Treatment sequences
Since T790M mutation status is unknown in the 1L four-state case, a treatment sequence consists of a 1L treatment and treatment options for both the T790M+ and T790M- cases at 2L and 2L+. Multiple treatment sequences are combined into a "txseq_list" object using `txseq_list()`. 

```{r}
txseq1 <- txseq(first = "erlotinib",
                second = c("osimertinib", "PBDC"),
                second_plus = c("PBDC + bevacizumab", "PBDC + bevacizumab"))
txseq2 <- txseq(first = "gefitinib",
                second = c("osimertinib", "PBDC"),
                second_plus = c("PBDC + bevacizumab", "PBDC + bevacizumab"))
txseqs <- txseq_list("Sequence 1" = txseq1, "Sequence 2" = txseq2, start_line = "first",
                     mutation = "unknown")
```

Its also useful to write a short convenience function for creating informative names for treatment strategies (i.e., treatment sequences), which can be used for plotting.
```{r}
# Convenience function to add factor names to data table
# for plotting
strategy_factor <- function(x, rev = FALSE){ 
  strategy_names <- names(txseqs)
  if (rev == FALSE){
    x[, strategy_name := factor(strategy_id, levels = 1:length(txseqs), 
                               labels = strategy_names)]
  } else{
    x[, strategy_name := factor(strategy_id, levels = rev(1:length(txseqs)), 
                                 labels = rev(strategy_names))]
  }
}
```

### Model structure
In the IVI-NSCLC model, the treatment sequences and model structure are closely connected: a four-state model is only possible when beginning at 1L and cannot be used to model outcomes with osimertinib. A model structure is specified with `model_structure()`. The survival distribution used to estimate the multi-state NMA and model transitions between health states is specified using the `dist` argument. A description of the relevant health states can be generated using `create_states()` and possible health state transitions are stored in a transition matrix generated using `create_trans_mat()`.

```{r}
struct <- model_structure(txseqs, dist = "weibull")

# Health states
states <- create_states(struct)
print(states)

# Transition matrix
tmat <- create_trans_mat(struct)
print(tmat)
```

As with treatment strategies, its useful to write a convenience function for generating informative names for health states for plotting.

```{r}
state_factor <- function(x){
  x[, state_name := factor(state_id, levels = 1:nrow(states), 
                           labels = states$state_name)]
}
```

### Constructing the model
We construct the economic model by combining the separate models for the health state transitions, utility, and costs.

#### Health state transition model
Health state transitions are simulated as a function of input data (which contains the covariates from the multi-state model describing differences in transition rates across treatments) and parameters (the coefficients from the multi-state NMA). These are automatically created as a function of the model structure, transition matrix, and patient population with `create_transmod_data()` and stored below in a data table named `transmod_data`. A fraction of patients are T790M mutation positive (and this fraction can vary across treatments). Coefficients from the multi-state NMA that are contained in `transmod_data` are extracted using `transmod_params()`. 

Recall from the discussion above that an individual-level model is required to simulate a CTSTM that that is a mixture of clock-reset and clock-forward approaches. A model of health state transitions for an individual-level CTSTM (iCTSTM) can be constructed with the `IndivCtstmTrans` class in `hesim`.  

```{r}
# Input data
transmod_data <- create_transmod_data(struct, tmat, pats, mutation_prob = .45)
## Print first 5 rows and and 10 covariates from data
print(transmod_data[1:5, 1:10]) 

# Parameters
transmod_params <- create_transmod_params(params, transmod_data)
## Print first 5 samples from the probability distribution and 4 covariates (which
## match those in 'transmod_data')
transmod_params$coefs$scale[1:5, 1:4]

# Health state transition model
transmod <- hesim::create_IndivCtstmTrans(transmod_params, transmod_data, tmat)
class(transmod)
```

#### Utility model
We construct a "mean" model for utility. Adverse events---which vary across treatments---are assumed to occur during the first month of treatment and cause a decrease in utility. After the first month, utility varies across health states, but it assumed constant across treatments.

```{r}
utilmod <- create_utilmod(params, struct, pats)
```

#### Cost models
We construct models for each of the cost categories.

```{r}
costmods <- create_costmods(params, struct, pats)
```

#### Combining the models
Now that the transition, utility, and cost models have been constructed, they can be combined to construct the complete economic model. We use the `IndivCtstm` class from `hesim`, and instantiate an iCTSTM.   

```{r}
econmod <- hesim::IndivCtstm$new(trans_model = transmod,
                                 utility_model = utilmod,
                                 cost_models = costmods)
```

### Simulation
#### Disease progression
The iCTSTM is used to simulate disease progression, QALYs, and costs. We begin by simulating disease progression with `$sim_disease()` and set the time horizon to 20 years. We compute the probability that a patient is in each of the four health states as a function of time. 

```{r}
econmod$sim_disease(max_t = 20)
econmod$sim_stateprobs(t = seq(0, 20 , 1/26)) # Biweekly probabilities
```

We plot mean state probabilities (averaged across the joint probability distribution of the parameters). 

```{r stateprobs}
# Plot of state probabilities
stprobs <- econmod$stateprobs_[, .(prob_mean = mean(prob),
                                     prob_lower = quantile(prob, .025),
                                     prob_upper = quantile(prob, .975)),
                                 by = c("strategy_id", "state_id", "t")]
state_factor(stprobs)
strategy_factor(stprobs)
ggplot(stprobs[t < 2], aes(x = t, y = prob_mean, col = strategy_name)) +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap(~state_name) + 
  xlab("Years") + ylab("Probability in health state") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "") 
```

Since [progression-free survival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progression-free_survival) and [overall survival](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/overall-survival) are the most commonly reported primary endpoints in clinical trials, they are also useful to compute. We measure PFS as time with stable disease and OS as time before death.

```{r pfs_os_curves}
curves <- econmod$stateprobs_[state_id == 1 | state_id == 4]
curves[, prob := ifelse(state_id == 4, 1 - prob, prob)] # OS is 1 - pr(death)
curves[, lab := factor(state_id, levels = c(1, 4), labels = c("PFS", "OS"))]
curves <- curves[, .(prob_mean = mean(prob),
                            prob_lower = quantile(prob, .025),
                            prob_upper = quantile(prob, .975)),
                          by = c("strategy_id", "lab", "t")]
strategy_factor(curves)
ggplot(curves[t < 2], aes(x = t, y = prob_mean, col = strategy_name)) +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap(~lab) + 
  xlab("Years") + ylab("Survival probability") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "") 
```

We can also summarize quantiles of the PFS and OS curves. Here, we plot the median of (mean) PFS and OS. 

```{r pfs_os_quantiles, fig.height = 3}
k <- .5 # quantile of interest
median_rows <- curves[, .I[which(prob_mean <=  1 - k)[1]], 
                      by = c("strategy_id", "lab")]$V1
median_dt <- curves[median_rows, ]
strategy_factor(median_dt, rev = TRUE)
ggplot(median_dt, aes(x = strategy_name, y = t)) + 
  facet_wrap(~lab, nrow = 2) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#d9230f") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "") +
  xlab("") + ylab("Median years") + 
  coord_flip() 
```


#### QALYs
Mean QALYs and life-years can be simulated for each randomly sampled parameter set by treatment sequence and health state. We simulate values without a discount rate and using a 3 percent discount rate, and plot undiscounted life-years.

```{r mean_lys, fig.height = 1.5}
# Simulate
econmod$sim_qalys(dr = c(0, .03))

# Plot
lys <- econmod$qalys_[dr == 0, .(mean_lys = mean(lys)),
                            by = c("strategy_id", "state_id")]
state_factor(lys)
strategy_factor(lys, rev = TRUE)
ggplot(lys, aes(x = strategy_name, y = mean_lys, fill = state_name)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "") +
  xlab("") + ylab("Mean life-years") + 
  coord_flip() 
```

#### Costs
Mean costs for each randomly sampled parameter set are simulated by health state, treatment strategy, and category assuming a 3 percent discount rate. Furthermore, now that both costs and QALYs have been simulated, we can summarize clinical benefits and costs (i.e,  compute mean costs and QALYs for each randomly sampled parameter set and treatment strategy). Here, we plot mean costs along with 95 percent credible intervals. 

```{r costs, fig.width = 4}
# Simulate
econmod$sim_costs(dr = .03)
ce_sim <- econmod$summarize()

# Plot
costs <- ce_sim$costs[dr == .03 , .(costs_mean = mean(costs),
                           costs_lower = quantile(costs, .025),
                           costs_upper = quantile(costs, .975)),
                        by = c("strategy_id", "category")]
strategy_factor(costs)
ggplot(costs[category == "total"], 
       aes(x = strategy_name, y = costs_mean)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#d9230f") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = costs_lower, 
                    ymax = costs_upper), width=.2) +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "") +
  xlab("") + ylab("Costs") + 
  scale_y_continuous(label = dollar_format()) 
```

We can also decompose costs by category. 

```{r costs_cat, fig.width = 4}
costs[, category_name := factor(category, levels = c("op", "inpt", "total"),
                                labels = c("Outptient", "Inpatient", "Total"))]
ggplot(costs[category != "total"], 
       aes(x = strategy_name, y = costs_mean, fill = category_name)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "") +
  xlab("") + ylab("Costs") + 
  scale_y_continuous(label = dollar_format()) 
```

We might also want to examine incremental costs relative to a comparator (say treatment sequence 1). 

```{r incr_costs, fig.width = 4}
# Incremental costs with Strategy 1 as the reference treatment
incr_costs <- ce_sim$costs[, costs_comparator := costs[1], 
                           by = c("category", "dr", "sample")]
incr_costs[, icosts := costs - costs_comparator]
incr_costs <- incr_costs[, .(icosts_mean = mean(icosts),
                             icosts_lower = quantile(icosts, .025),
                             icosts_upper = quantile(icosts, .975)),
               by = c("category", "dr", "strategy_id")]
strategy_factor(incr_costs)
ggplot(incr_costs[dr == .03 & category == "total" & 
                    strategy_id != 1], 
       aes(x = strategy_name, y = icosts_mean)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#d9230f") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = icosts_lower, 
                    ymax = icosts_upper), width=.2) +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "") +
  scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) +
  xlab("") + ylab("Incremental costs") + 
  scale_y_continuous(label = dollar_format())
```


## A three-state model for second line treatment
Coming soon.

# Decision analysis
Cost-effectiveness analysis can be [performed using `hesim`](https://innovationvalueinitiative.github.io/hesim/articles/icea.html) with the functions `icea()` and `icea_pw()`. For this analysis, we used the first treatment sequence as the comparator and assume a willingness to pay per QALY of \$100,000.  

```{r icea}
icea <- hesim::icea(ce_sim, dr = .03)
icea_pw <- hesim::icea_pw(ce_sim, comparator = 1, dr = .03)
```

We report [incremental cost-effective ratios (ICERs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_cost-effectiveness_ratio)---a commonly used measure for summarizing the cost-effectiveness of interventions.

```{r icer}
icer <- hesim::icer_tbl(icea_pw,
                        k = 100000, # WTP per QALY 
                        cri = TRUE,
                        rownames = c("Incremental QALYs", "Incremental costs ($)", 
                                     "Incremental NMB ($)", "ICER ($ per QALY)", 
                                     "Conclusion"),
                        colnames = names(txseqs))
knitr::kable(icer)
```

We can also visualize the degree of uncertainty in our simulated cost and QALY values with a cost-effectiveness plane. Simulated points for a given treatment sequence to the right of the dotted line are cost-effective relative to treatment sequence 1 given our willingness to pay threshold of \$100,000.

```{r ceplane}
ylim <- max(icea_pw$delta[, ic]) * 1.1
xlim <- max(icea_pw$delta[, ie]) * 1.1
strategy_factor(icea_pw$delta)
ggplot(icea_pw$delta, aes(x = ie, y = ic, col = strategy_name)) + 
  geom_jitter(size = .5)  + 
  xlab("Incremental QALYs") + ylab("Incremental costs") +
  scale_y_continuous(label = dollar, limits = c(-ylim, ylim)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-xlim, xlim)) +
 scale_colour_discrete(name = "") +
  geom_abline(slope = 100000, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + geom_vline(xintercept = 0)
```

A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) is useful way to measure uncertainty in our decision about whether a treatment sequence is cost-effective. More precisely, the CEAC plots the proportion of simulations from the PSA that a treatment sequence is cost-effective relative to the comparator (y-axis) against different willingness to pay thresholds (x-axis).

```{r ceac}
strategy_factor(icea_pw$ceac)
ggplot(icea_pw$ceac, aes(x = k, y = prob, col = strategy_name)) +
  geom_line() + xlab("Willingness to pay") +
  ylab("Probability cost-effective") +
  scale_x_continuous(label = scales::dollar) +
  scale_colour_discrete(name = "")
```

Finally, we can plot the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), which is a measure of the maximum amount that a decision maker would be willing to pay to reduce all uncertainty in all parameters. 

```{r evpi}
ggplot(icea$evpi, aes(x = k, y = evpi)) +
  geom_line() + xlab("Willingness to pay") +
  ylab("Expected value of perfect information") +
  scale_x_continuous(label = scales::dollar) +
  scale_y_continuous(label = scales::dollar)
```
