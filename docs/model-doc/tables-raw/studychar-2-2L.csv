AURA2,"Inclusion:

Aged at least 18 years. Japan patients aged at least 20 years.
Locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy
Radiological documentation of disease progression:
following 1st line EGFR TKI treatment but who have not received further treatment OR following prior therapy with an EGFR TKI and a platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Patients who received prior EGFR TKI and platinum-based doublet chemotherapy may have also received additional lines of treatment. All patients must have documented radiological progression on the last treatment administered prior to enrolling in the study.

Disease progression following 1st line EGFR TKI treatment or following prior EGFR TKI and platinum-containing doublet chemotherapy.
Confirmation that the tumour harbours an EGFR mutation known to be associated with EGFR TKI sensitivity (including G719X, exon 19 deletion, L858R, L861Q). Patients must have central confirmation of tumour T790M mutation positive status from a biopsy sample taken after confirmation of disease progression on the most recent treatment regimen.
World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status 0-1 with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks.
At least one lesion, not previously irradiated and not chosen for biopsy during the study screening period, that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥ 10mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis ≥ 15mm) with computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements.

Treatment with an EGFR-TKI within 8 days of study entry; any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents or other anticancer drugs within 14 days of study entry; previous treatment with AZD9291 (or 3rd generation TKIs); major surgery within 4 weeks; radiotherapy treatment to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks; current treatment with potent inhibitors of CYP2C8 and potent inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4.
Unresolved toxicities from prior therapy.
Unstable spinal cord compression/brain metastases.
Severe/uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled hypertension, bleeding diatheses or infection.
Refractory nausea/vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases or bowel resection.
Cardiac disease.
Past history of ILD, drug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease.

AURA3,"Eligible patients who were screened at 126 trial centers
from August 2014 through September 2015
had histologic or cytologic evidence of locally
advanced or metastatic non–small-cell lung can cancer
and of disease progression after first-line
EGFR-TKI therapy. The documented presence of
an EGFR mutation and central confirmation of the
T790M variant on the cobas EGFR Mutation Test
(Roche Molecular Systems) after first-line EGFRTKI
treatment was required. All patients were required
to provide a blood sample at screening to
test for T790M in plasma circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA) on the cobas EGFR Mutation Test, version

metastases that had not been treated with glucocorticoids

dose of a trial drug were eligible for inclusion.",≥18 years,IIIb or IV,0-1 (WHO),--,--,--,--,Mutation + (Exon 19 or L858R),Yes,Yes,No,No,"1. Treatment with any of the following:
• Treatment with more than one prior line of treatment for advanced NSCLC
• Treatment with an EGFR-TKI (e.g., erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib) within 8 days or
approximately 5x half-life, whichever is the longer, of the first dose of study
treatment. (If sufficient washout time has not occurred due to schedule or PK
properties, an alternative appropriate washout time based on known duration and
time to reversibility of drug related adverse events could be agreed upon by
AstraZeneca and the Investigator)
• Any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents or other anticancer drugs from
a previous treatment regimen or clinical study within 14 days of randomization
• Previous treatment with AZD9291, or a 3rd generation EGFR TKI
• Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) within 4 weeks of
randomization
• Radiotherapy treatment to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field
of radiation within 4 weeks of randomization
• Subjects currently receiving (or unable to stop use at least 1 week prior to
receiving the first dose of AZD9291) medications or herbal supplements known to
be potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 (Appendix F)
• Treatment with an investigational drug within five half-lives of the compound
2. Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than CTCAE grade 1 (with the
exception of alopecia grade 2) at the time of starting study treatment.
3. Spinal cord compression or brain metastases unless asymptomatic, stable and not requiring
steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment.
4. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled
hypertension and active bleeding diatheses, which in the investigator’s opinion makes it
undesirable for the subject to participate in the trial or which would jeopardise compliance
with the protocol, or active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Screening for chronic conditions is not required.
